# How it works

ChipTune implements an 8-bit Programmable Sound Generator (PSG).
Input is from a serial UART interface.
Output is PWM audio.

# How to test

The ChipTune project can be interfaced to a computer COM port (9600,n,8,1).
An analog PWM filter and audio driver are needed for the test rig.
